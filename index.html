   <h1> Microbots: how do they work?</h1>

   <div id="blurb">
     <p>
       Micro-robots capable of swimming like micro-organisms hold tremendous
       potential for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and
       micro-surgery. However, swimming under the microscope poses significant
       challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by fluid dynamics at
       small scales. Common swimming strategies used at larger scales become
       largely ineffective. In recent decades, scientists and engineers across
       different disciplines have come together to develop a range of
       micro-swimmers capable of navigating the microscopic world.

     <p>
       To enhance public understanding, we have created an educational game that
       allows players to gain virtual hands-on experience with the exciting
       applications of micro-swimmers in an entertaining manner. The game was
       developed by an interdisciplinary team of students from Santa Clara
       University, including students from mechanical engineering, computer
       science, and digital arts. Our goal is to provide an enjoyable experience
       while showcasing the possibilities offered by micro-swimmers. If you have
       any questions about this outreach effort, please feel free to email us at
       opak@scu.edu. We hope you enjoy playing the game!
     </p>

     <p>
       The microswimmer in the game is based on the pioneering work by Najafi and
       Golestanian (Physical Review E, 69, 062901, 2004). Support by the National
       Science Foundation (Grant numbers 1830958 and 1931292) is gratefully
       acknowledged.
